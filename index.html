				 	<p>The Port of Tacoma is a major industry for the area, responsible for 42,100 jobs and nearly $3 billion in economic activity each year. Using digital elevation models derived from LiDAR data, we assessed how sea level rise may impact port operations in the future.</p>

				<div>
					<p>Our research indicated that a very likely prediction of sea level rise is an overall increase of 3.4 feet by the year 2150. While much more dramatic sea level increase scenarios exist, the 3.4-foot increase is a central estimate if greenhouse gas production continues at the current rate.</p>

Slide the bar left to see where an additional three feet of tidal range would impact the port facilities. <br><a href="Sea_Level_Rise_in_Tacoma.pdf">Click here for the white paper.</a></p>
